INSTALLATION

Linux:
Copy pamm_linux and the directory "img" to whereever you want. It will find PA automatically if you at least started it once.
You need to have the QT4 libraries installed as well as libzip and libqjson.

Mac OS:
Copy pamm_mac and the directory "img" to whereever you want.
Since I'm not sure how to bundle, you need to manually download the QT libraries: http://download.qt-project.org/official_releases/qt/4.8/4.8.5/qt-mac-opensource-4.8.5.dmg
Also libzip needs to be installed, but I think this is present by default? Sorry, I'm not a maccy.
It also requires libqjson which may come with the Qt stuff? But maybe not.
